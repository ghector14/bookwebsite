          <h3><span class="icon-dashboard"></span>PART 1 – The principles</h3>
            <ul>
              <p>ONE: The principle of thought <br><br>
                Understanding the nature of thought is the foundation of living a happy and functional life. Thinking goes on whether we want it or not and 
                it's an impersonal element of our existence. Your thoughts, not your circumstances determine how you feel. The same circumstance can and will mean entirely 
                different things to different people. The significance of everything that happens in your life is determined by your thought system. This is where every piece of 
                information you have collected over your lifetime is stored. This is why people rarely change their religious or political views because our thought systems are so familiar
                 to us they seem to be giving us true and accurate information.
              </p>
              <p>TWO: The principle of mood <br><br>
                When you are in a high mood, life looks good. You have perspective and common sense. In low moods, we lose our ability to listen, and our perspective flies out the window. Moods are part 
                of being a human being and you can't avoid them. The same behavior by our children that is cute and playful when we are in a high mood is irritating when we are in a low mood. But the way you feel about 
                something will always depend on your mood. The only feelings you will ever experience in a low mood are negative; thus it makes no sense to trust or act on those feelings. The solution is to wait until your
                 mood rises, which it will, on its own. The less attention you give your thinking in low moods the quicker your mood will rise. When you understand that it is your mood- not your life- that has suddenly changed, you have a better perspective.
              </p>
              <p>
                THREE: The principle of separate realities <br><br>
		            Each thought system is unique to itself. Our parents, backgrounds, interpretations, memory, circumstances- many factors play roles in determining our thought system. The combinations are endless and it's impossible 
                to duplicate between individuals. When we expect to see things differently, the compassion we have for ourselves and others rises dramatically. The moment we expect otherwise, the potential for conflict exists, such in relationships 
                or among nations. When we understand the principle of separate realities we are free from these catalysts of problems. We can continue to maintain any belief or opinion we have- the difference will be that our personal beliefs, and other people's 
                objections to them, will not be such a source of hostility or pain. When you approach someone, not in an attempt to change their beliefs but with a genuine interest and respect for their view of life, defenses drop, hearts open, and it opens the door for growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                FOURTH: The principle of feelings <br><br>
		            Your feelings are a foolproof guidance system that helps you navigate through life. Your feelings let you know when you are off track and headed toward unhappiness and conflict. Our feelings are for our mental health as the warning lights on our dashboards are to vehicles. 
                Whenever we are feeling angry, jealous, resentful, greedy, depressed, or in some way unhappy, we need to understand that these feelings are being manufactured by our thought system and are not natural, accurate, or representative of reality. Continue thinking in the same
                unproductive way, and you will not find the answers you are looking for. There is no magic or mystery to healthy psychological functioning: healthy functioning is the feeling we experience when little if anything is on our minds. So what do we do when we feel angry, depressed, or anxious? 
                Trust and see the truth in the principle of feelings. Negative feelings will disappear quickly enough if we simply let them alone. They are created by our thoughts- to focus on them or analyze them will only extend and deepen the negative experience.
